## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
- 18 Birides 
    - Gives you the ability to preview any golf course you want by taking advantage of some sort of maps API
    - Uses gps to show your distance from the golf hole, eliminating the need to buy an expensive golf range finder
    - Serves as a record for all golf rounds you played, calculating your handicap automatically for you (something you had to do manually).
    
- Reddit
    - The way the app displays posts
    - The ability to see a summed up count of upvotes and downvotes. Post votes is usually updated automatically by the second.

- Starbucks
    - All the drinks on the app are customizable, giving you control on what goes into your drink.
    - I enjoy the ability to order items on the app and being able to pick it up, skipping the line. 
    - The app provides a map that shows the many Starbucks that are located around you.
    
    
## Notes

The main challenges I had with creating this application was navigating through Xcode and becoming familiar with the UI. I have never programmed in Swift before, so I had to do a little bit of research to implement the text color change as well.
